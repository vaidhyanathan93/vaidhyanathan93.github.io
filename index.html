                        <p>Made an Algorithm for Byzantine Fault on Hadoop System. Byzantine faults are the random faults that occur in the machine. Which is frequently occurring the large scale data systems in the field like genetic engineering. This problem was brought to us during the international conference on Maths held in Chennai during that period. So take this as a challenge and solved this. A computational hash for the record being generated and the result are being analysed with intelligence provided using the results of the historical record. And if any error is found will be rerun on a different system</p>

                        <p>This project aims to detect and correct the error during the transmission of signals. While transmitting the data over the network corruption might occur. This project simulates how these type of error can be detected and corrected in the chip level rather than in the application level. This project is a hardware project that performs the simulation of syndrome calculator.</p>
