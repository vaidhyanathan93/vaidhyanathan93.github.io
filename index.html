                        <p>Made an Algorithm for Byzantine Fault on Hadoop System. Byzantine faults are the random faults that occur in the machine. Which is frequently occuing the large scale data systems in the field like genetic engineering. This problem was brought to us during the internation conference on Maths held in chennai during that period.So take this as a challenge and solved this. 
                           A computational hash for the record being generated and result are being anlysed with intelligence provided using the historical records results. And if any error being found will be rerun on different system

                        <p>This project aims to detect and correct the error during the transmission of signals.While transmitting the data over the network corruption might occur. This project simulate how these type of error can be detected and corrected in the chip level rather than in the application level. This project is an hardware project that performs the simulation of syndrome calculator.</p>
