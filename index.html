<h2 id="awards-and-achivements-from-work">ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://vtornet.com" target="_blank">Creator of VTORNET</a></strong> - 2018. Creator of VTORNET. A distributed web which uses the blockchain and BitTorrent to completely decentralise the internet. PS: This project is in active development. Distributed DNS, Data partitioning, Distributed tracker, reward systems are some of the key features.</li><br/>
    <li><strong><a href="https://developer.freshsales.io" target="_blank">Creator of Platform for Freshsales</a></strong> - 2018. While started working in Freshworks created a platform for Freshsales where anyone can able to build apps for our product. Which gained much popularity among the developers and more than 60 apps got published within a week.</li><br/>

<li><b>2016-2018.</b> - Improvised the product performace in Zoho by 2x and Desinged and developed a high scable solution for N^4 problem which can scale up to multi million users. Currently serving Million Users - 2017-2018</li><br/>
<li><strong>Spotlight Award</strong> - 2015 AHI for Innovation. Created a system for document processing of the Electronic health records which will process the document with high accuracy using a semi-intelligent decision tree. More than 1 million documents started using this feature after this implementation.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Spotlight Award</strong> - 2015 AHI for Innovation- Build a semi quto detecting bug system using pattern recoginsation to find the most bugs in the code. </li><br/>
<li><strong>Extra Mile Award</strong>  - 2014 AHI for Achiving high quality, consistency and efficient team work</li><br/>

<li><strong>CTS Certified Student of the year - 2014</strong>- Cogizant certified student of the year once among the few elite students in the country to secure that award</li><br/>


<li><strong>Maths Club Member -2010-2014</strong>- Maths club is the elite group of people in the university with very high anyaltical and intelligence.</li><br/>

</ul>

<h2 id="pet-projects">Pet Projects involving enginnering</h2>

<p>The following are the some of the pet projects I worked.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><a href="http://vtornet.com">VTorNet</a>Vtornet is a fully decentralised P2P web.The system solves the classic problem of P2P web along with scaling problems like distributed DNS,Partial site loading,Distributed tracker,Authenticity,Recent update.<br/><br/> PS: Yet to attach full paper. <b>Patent process is going on </b></p>

</li>


<li><p><a href="https://github.com/Megadeus/BFT-on-Hadoop">Byzantine Fault tolerance system on Apache Hadoop</a>(Thesis and project)</p>

<p>Made an Algorithm for Byzantine Fault on Hadoop System. Byzantine faults are the random faults that occur in the machine. Which is frequently occuing the large scale data systems in the field like genetic engineering. This problem was brought to us during the internation conference on Maths held in chennai during that period.So take this as a challenge and solved this. 

A computational hash for the record being generated and result are being anlysed with intelligence provided using the historical records results. And if any error being found will be rerun on different system</p></li>

<li><p><em>Error Detection and Error control during transmission</em>(HardWare project)</p>

<p>This project aims to detect and correct the error during the transmission of signals.While transmitting the data over the network corruption might occur. This project simulate how these type of error can be detected and corrected in the chip level rather than in the application level. This project is an hardware project that performs the simulation of syndrome calculator.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pet-projects">Pet Projects as application</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Transit System</a>(Platform for CTS)</p>

<p>Transit system is the platform build for Coginzant to create apps(like app store) for thier entriprised. Worked as intern for the designing of the whole system alone. It is now part of CTS.</p></li>


<li><p><a href="https://github.com/vaidhyanathan93/E-resourcelocator">E-Learning Resource Locator</a>(Enterprise System)</p>

<p>E-Learning Resource Locator is a platform for students and teacher to interact. This system is highly customisable and used by any age.</p></li>
</ul>
