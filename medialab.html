<br/>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Started as a 14-year-old who first saw a computer for the first time to a person whose work is being used by Millions and Millions of users day by day over the period of time is the path not travelled by many with limited resources. started as a newbie, Hacker, Ethical Hacker, Developer, Open source contributor, Volunteer, Architect and now as Lead Engineer. Curiosity and Excellence are the key driving force.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My passion for the world of technology and programming started at my age of 14. On my quest to acquire knowledge, I started visiting the library and searched limited internet available at that time. I stocked up several books from the library and from my seniors and devotedly read through them every day. I took my self-interest a step further and put my hands to code at the age of 15. My first program was the Tic-tac-toe game. Then my interests inclined toward the area of the Internet and its architecture. In the hunt for my curiosity, I happen to read a lot about Technologies. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to explore further, I took Information Technology in my Undergraduate. During the course time, I learnt a lot in different fields including but not limited to security, Architecture, Web. During my pre-final year, I started hacking about e-commerce sites and about 10 games including (Candy Crush, Google pay)and turned out as Ethical Hacker. With the help of my college professors, I entered in the area of research in the Big data and analytics at the age of 19. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my pre final year, Industries in India started hunting for good and talented fellows. I was approached by many companies such as SBI, CTS, IBM for their research projects. I happened to help three companies as a research internship for a period of 3&ndash;4 months. Cognizant recognised my talents and awarded Most prestigious Cognizant Certified Student Award(One of very few students to get in the whole country). </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My philosophy is Innovation is the key which makes humanity to achieve the greater heights. My applied engineering combined with my curiosity opened up many paths. During the internship period, I happen to implement a platform for the whole cognizant(Similar to Google Play store) for the app development. It is the first of its kind platform for B2B business. And for State Bank of India Provided analytics research internship and helped them recover about &#8377;10M bad loan using the data analytics and intelligence.
I happened to help my Head of the Department for his Second PhD thesis on (Large-scale Computation algorithm).A part of which happened to my final year project(Byzantine fault tolerance on Hadoop). </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After my Undergraduate program, I happen to Join AthenaHealth as Software engineer and designed Text recognition algorithm for medical prescription and being used by more than Millions of doctors prescription. I happened to join ZohoCorportation to meet the technical demand for their growing organisation. During the course time, I happened to work on much complex design systems. Which attracted the attention of many senior executives in our organisation and reached the designation as Lead. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The web has been introduced to the world decades back. But still, there are many missing pieces in the puzzle. Apart from work I always look into the place for improvement and do some research on those. Web happens to be one of those. My recent work on the creation of a decentralised web system has been started and received much appreciation from my peers. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past five years, I have been spending my every day of my life to achieve the greatness, As a specialist engineer in scaling and architectural innovation team, My work has been ranging from improvising the algorithms, networks, Code to scale from thousand to Billions of requests per hour. Each day My understanding of the customers and their use cases pushing me from doing something great to excellence. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Having in-depth knowledge alone is not enough. Greatness can be achieved by having strong people from many fields. Which happens to be MIT Media Lab. </p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 4 years of the graduate in Engineering and 5 years of working in the leading companies. I sincerely hope that I can further enrich my knowledge and full fill my research aspirations by doing Graduate along with PhD. MIT Media Lab is the place what I have been looking for all those years.<br />
